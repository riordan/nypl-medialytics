This is the draft code for managing NYPL media tracking. Right now it's barely importing data from the iTunes reports.

Required Modules (not base install)
xlrd
xlwt


Installation:
	Install required packages:
		From commandline type "sudo easy_install xlrd, xlwt"
		You may be prompted for your computer's password
		
	File Configuration:
		Place all iTunes reports into a folder named "sampleFiles"
		Place iTunes.py into folder one level ABOVE "sampleFiles"
	

How to use:
	Once installed and configured, add all iTunes reports to folder, then from commandline type "python iTunes.py". Will output a file ituexport.xls with download data.


ROADMAP

Phase 1 - import iTunes data
Phase 1.5 - export cumulative iTunes data

Phase 2 - Import Google Analytics data
Phase 2.5 - Merge and compare iTunes and Google Analytics

Phase n - exports all data as pretty pretty webpages
